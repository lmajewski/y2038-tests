# The y2038 tests description:
Test for y2038 development (testing kernel syscalls)

This repository contains extracted from y20380_sandbox tests for Y2038 syscalls compliance.

Those corresponds to sandbox-devel-11.02.2019 branch from github.com/lmajewski/y2038_sandbox

Storing those tests as a separate repo will facilitate re-use of it in e.g. OE/Yocto meta layers
